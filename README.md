# React Native Essentials

Welcome to the React Native Essentials workshop! This hands-on workshop will go through the fundamentals of React Native from “init-ing” our application to getting our app to looking good to digging into native libraries. It will wrap up with a discussion on more “intermediate” topics and address any questions the class may have. The objective of this workshop is to help React developers take the plunge into mobile and show the similarities between the two platforms.

## Quick Start

For the full instructions on how to setup your environment for React Native development, head on over to our React Native Essentials Starter Pack [Environment Setup](https://github.com/infinitered/ReactNativeEssentialsStarterPack/blob/main/docs/environment-setup-guide.md) doc (be sure to also set up either your iOS Simulator and/or Android Emulator).

1. Verify environment status:

```bash
./packages/mobile/scripts/setup/verify-environment
```

2. Run the project setup script:

```bash
yarn setup
```

3. Start the metro bundler:

```bash
yarn start
```

4. Build in dev mode:

- Android: by typing `a` in metro, or in a new shell instance:

  ```bash
  yarn android
  ```

- iOS: by typing `i` in metro, or in a new shell instance:

  ```bash
  yarn ios
  ```

5. Build for your device:

- [Android link](./docs/simulators-setup.md#yarn-android)
- [iOS link](./docs/simulators-setup.md#launching-a-specific-simulator)
